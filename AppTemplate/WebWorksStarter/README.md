# WebWorksStarter Sample Application
The _**WebWorksStarter Sample Application" repository provides the shell of a WebWorks project that can get you started quickily.  Whether you need a quick project to test a feature or function, or you are starting an application for the first time.  Using a simple index.html (for content), style.css (for style), functions.js and screens.js (for everything else), an application can be built in a matter of minutes.  There are even simple images that can be changed with your own.

The _**WebWorks-Community-APIs**_ repository is an area where members of the community can post up their JavaScript Extensions to share with the rest of the world.  

All APIs and samples shared in this repository are Open Source under the  [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)
